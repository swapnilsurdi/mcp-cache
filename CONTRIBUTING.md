## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request:

2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, Node version, MCP client)
   - Relevant logs from `~/.mcp-cache/` or Claude logs

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Please:

1. Explain the use case
2. Describe the proposed solution
3. Consider alternatives
4. Be open to discussion

### Pull Requests

We love pull requests! Here's the process:

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-cache.git
   cd mcp-cache
   ```

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation if needed

4. **Test your changes**
   ```bash

   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `test:` - Adding tests
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

6. **Push and create PR**

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn
- An MCP server to test with

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build project
npm run build

# Watch mode for development
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

```
mcp-cache/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts        # CLI entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ proxy.ts        # Core proxy logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ transport.ts    # Server communication
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cache.ts        # Cache management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ query.ts        # Query engine
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.ts       # Configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types.ts        # TypeScript types
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/               # Compiled JavaScript
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/              # Tests (coming soon)
â””â”€â”€ docs/               # Documentation
```

### Testing

Currently, testing is manual. To test your changes:

1. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test with a real MCP server**
   ```bash
   node dist/index.js python -m chrome_automation_mcp
   # or
   node dist/index.js npx @playwright/mcp@latest
   ```

3. **Test with Claude Desktop**
   - Update `claude_desktop_config.json` to point to your local build
   - Restart Claude Desktop
   - Try operations that trigger large responses

4. **Check logs**
   ```bash
   tail -f /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-*.log
   ```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `async/await` over promises
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Query a cached response with various search methods
 * @param data - The cached response data
 * @param query - Search query string
 * @param options - Query options (mode, limit, offset)
 * @returns Query results with pagination info
 */
query(data: any, query: string, options: QueryOptions = {}): any {
  // Implementation
}
```
